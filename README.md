# FitHub 

## Introduction

Author: Kushagra Sharma

This personal project was created as a part of CPSC 210: Software Construction at The University of British Columbia. The project is developed in Java, employing various software design principles and concepts taught in class. The application aims to provide a practical and optimal solution for anyone ranging from fitness enthusiasts to absolute beginners.

**Why is this project of interest to me?**

The most important reason I chose this project is that I relate to what it feels like trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle as a university student. Having to eat right and hit the gym while also focusing on academics and maintaining grades is not easy. (not to mention the forever-lasting job search)
Secondly, I have been losing weight over the summer of 2024. My two closest friends also hit the gym: one of them is trying to gain muscle and the other one maintains his physique. The app offers three "paths": bulk, cut, and maintain. I have a deep understanding of all 3 of those paths due to my friends, so I chose this project to implement this knowledge and try to help others.

## What is FitHub and what will it do?

FitHub is a fitness partner built for individuals looking to establish a structured fitness routine that aligns with their specific goals. Be it gaining muscle, losing fat, or simply maintaining the current physical state, FitHub offers workout and diet plans tailored to user-specific properties like height, weight and weekly workout intensity. The main goal of this project is to promote a healthy and balanced lifestyle and **help** people achieve it.
